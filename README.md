# LiteracyProCodingChallenge

This challenge was created in Visual Studio 2019 using MVC Core and Entity Framework Core.

To create the required database tables, please update the PersonalPurchaseTrackerContext connection string in appsettings.json to point to the database you want to use. Then run "Update-Database" from the PM Console.  This will create the required tables and seed them with data using the pre-configured Migration.

Alternatively you can use the following script: PersonalPurchaseTracker/InitializeDatabases.sql

Please contact Tim Hanks if you have any problems building or running the solution.

Thank you!
